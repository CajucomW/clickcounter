This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Simple Click Counting App

In this project I recreated something I learned in class regarding basic application of the "State" object to render components. 

### `"Click Here"`

As the instruction suggests, click the text and watch the number go up, up, and up!
On the "Click Here" text, there's an #### `onClick` event attached to a function. Within the function, the state is reset to add +1 to the defined object that was originally set to 0 (zero). Every #### `onClick` event adds +1 the state, which increases the counter by, well, 1!
